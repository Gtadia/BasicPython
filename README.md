# BasicPython
Basic Python code created for purposes to learn. Each crucial point in each section will be in a new function so that you can run each section individually

The majority of the code that you see in each file comes from Corey Schafer's Python videos (and one Python Engineer video), which I believe that he does a great job at explaining and structuring his videos. I also added bits and pieces of Python knowledge that I thought were curcial/interesting that Corey missed but other than that (and the different variable names and values), not too much has changed.
